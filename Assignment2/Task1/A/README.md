# A) "Me spell rite"

The Evil Lord Wladimir has cast the Spellus Incorrectus magical spell on your fellow students.<br>
Your task is to implement a simple spell checker that decides whether each individual word in a text file is spelled correctly.<br>
You might use the [english word list](https://github.com/Atrolide/Algorithms-Python/blob/main/Assignment2/Task1/A/english_words.txt) available in this directory.<br>
Try: a naive (linear list) approach, string BBST, trie and a hash map. <br>
You may use library solutions for BBST, e.g. std::ordered_set or alike.<br>
Compare running times for dictionary building and spell checking on a large piece of text.<br>
Your report should contain description of algorithms, comparison findings including graphs showing the relation of RT against the text length.<br>
