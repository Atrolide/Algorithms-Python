# B) "Triwizard Tournament"

One competition in the TT is to get out of a labyrinth as quickly as possible.<br>
Your task as the tournament supervisor is:<br>
Given the labyrinth map, initial positions of the three competing wizzards and their speeds (in corridors per minute)
predict which of them will reach the exit first. <br>
Assume that the magical wands used in the play are capable of guiding the wizards to the exit along a shortest possible path.<br> 
The `BFS` should be used exactly once.<br>
