# "Aunt's Namesday"

Your beloved aunt Petunia is throwing her namesday party, to which as usual, she invites all her friends and family.<br>
There are however some animosities among the invited guests. <br>
Aunt's idea is to have two separate tables, so that no two disliking one another people would have to sit at the same table.<br>
Given the list of the invited guests and the corresponding list of your aunt's suggestions on "who doesn't like whom", your task, as your aunt's dear little pumpkin sausage computer genius, is to use a recursive DFS algorithm to set up a "sitting scheme".<br>
