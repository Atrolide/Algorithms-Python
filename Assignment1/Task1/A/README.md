 Implement the following pattern matching algorithms: 
* `Brute-force`
* `Sunday`
* `KMP`
* `FSM`
* `Rabin-Karp`
* `Gusfield Z`

Compare their running times using chapters of a book, with a small (few words or a sentence) 
and a large pattern (a paragraph).

Your report should contain some description of the algorithms and, most importantly, your findings.

Include a graph showing the relation of RT against the text length.
(This implies that you have to use several different lengths, which are placed on the x-axis of a graph.)

The results should be reproducible.
