Prove empirically that there can be situations in which

 * `Binary Sunday` is at least twice as fast as `Gusfield Z`
 * `KMP` is at least twice as fast as `Rabin-Karp`
 * `Rabin-Karp` is at least twice as fast as `Sunday`
  
It means that you should present a specific P and a specific T for which this happens.<br>
T should be at least 100kB long. The results should be reproducible.<br>
