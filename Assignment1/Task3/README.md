# "Jewish-style carp"

```
Devise a version of `Rabin-Karp` algorithm which will check if for a given picture
(a two-dimensional array of arbitrary items)
`M` by `N` large its top-right `K` by `K` corner is duplicated somewhere in the picture.

Your algorithm should replace slow modulo prime operations with faster bitwise mask &'s.

Do make sure that the RT is at most linear in the number of pixels in the text.
