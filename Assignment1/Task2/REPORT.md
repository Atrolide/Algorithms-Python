## Brute Force Search Algorithm:
The Brute Force Search Algorithm, also known as the Naive Algorithm, is a simple algorithm that searches for a pattern within a text by comparing every character of the text with the pattern. It works by starting at the first character of the text and comparing it with the first character of the pattern. If they match, it moves on to the second character of both the text and pattern, and continues this process until either a mismatch occurs or the entire pattern is found. If the pattern is found, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.


Now, let's go through the implementation of the Brute Force Search Algorithm line by line:
