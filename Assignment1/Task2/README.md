# "What was that char again?"

```
Implement the `Brute-force` and `Sunday` algorithms so that they accept wildcards `?` and `*`.
Your implementation should produce a Boolean value of a match found or not.
The wildcards and `\` itself can be escaped with a backslash.
Explain your extensions to the algorithms in your report.
