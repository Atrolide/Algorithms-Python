# "What was that char again?"

Implement the `Brute-force` and `Sunday` algorithms so that they accept wildcards `?` and `*`.<br>
Your implementation should produce a Boolean value of a match found or not.<br>
The wildcards and `\` itself can be escaped with a backslash.<br>
Explain your extensions to the algorithms in your report.<br>
